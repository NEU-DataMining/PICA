You will be provided with the conversation history between AI and the USER, as well as the AI's response.

Your task is to rate the response on one metric.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the conversation history carefully and identify the main topic and key points discussed.
2. Read the response and compare it to the conversation history. Check if the response is consistent with the information and context provided in the conversation history.
3. Assign a score for consistency on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
